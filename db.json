This post below was supposed to be included so HERE you go!   \n\n\nMany of you are probably aware that my focus lately has been on setting up a new podcast studio and bringing Destiny’s premiere podcast to life. \n\n**TLDR:** \n\nI am excited to unveil Bridges Podcast, where Destiny's dynamic discussions meet the insightful perspectives of both notable figures (politicians, streamers, Hollywood writers, experts, etc) and everyday voices (normie and non-grass touching alike). \n\nEach episode promises to ignite robust conversations around politics and current events. Imagine the energy of Destiny's streams, enriched by a wider array of voices, live in podcast format. I am looking for people who are open to coming to Miami and want to talk about ideas to apply to be on the show. I will be pairing panelists with high-octane guests based on similar interests in the topic. \n\nWant to join the conversation? Applications are now live (thanks Cake). Please apply [here.](https://destiny.gg/BridgesPodcast)\n\n [https://destiny.gg/BridgesPodcast](https://destiny.gg/BridgesPodcast)  \n\n**Podcast Details:**\n\n**Show Format:**   \nThe show is going to have two parts:   \nI. In-depth interview and conversation between Destiny, notsoErudite, and the main guest (a high-octane person like a politician, notable content creator, lobbyist, actors, etc.). \\~1.5 hours\n\nII. A panel show following where the main guest is joined by 4-6 other panelists to have a conversation about the topics focused on that day, which will likely be broader social commentary and politics. This ideally will be more debate-like which panelists selected to represent a broad array of opinions on the topic. \\~2 hours\n\n**Show Date:**\n\n*Launch Date:* I am aiming for November, but there is a lot to do between now and then, but fingers crossed!  \n*Show time:* Show will be on Fridays starting at \\~5:00pm ET! Time may adjust as we get closer to launch so stay tuned! \n\n**Podcast Location:**  \nMiami Beach, Florida\n\n**Topics:**   \nTopics will be generated between Destiny and I. They will likely be reflecting current news/events/topics as well as catering to the main guests specialty interest (e.g., if Dr K came on, we would talk at length about psychology, mental health etc. A criminal justice lawyer we may talk about issues in the justice system). The topics will vary as much as common political conversations do. \n\n**Purpose of the show:**   \nAs you know, Destiny is trying to have a greater world impact and I want to help facilitate that dream where I can. Like you guys, I believe in the gnome. As the name suggests, the goal is to bridge conversations across ideology, political affiliation, demographics, and even Internet vs non-Internet culture. There are so few spaces that are willing to engage in conversation that isn't just partisan circle-jerking, but will actually try to wrestle with ideas. People are incredibly disenfranchised with the state of current politics and I think there is a large need for the DGG, \"Lone Wolf Sigma Male\" ideology that doesn't rely on a specific political camp. \n\n**How you can help:** \n\n1. When the new channel opens (yes, we will be making a separate channel for the show) please subscribe to it and start engaging with content so it can get monetized as quickly as possible. \n2. Share the show with your friends and Mom, hopefully, it will feel less online and therefore will transfer well to the general public. \n3. If you know content creators who may want to be a panelist, encourage them to apply. If you know larger-scale creators who you think may be willing to come on the show, please send them to me (NSE). \n\n**Application Questions**\n\n*Why are there no posted topics in the application?*  \nI will be pairing people by interested topic and likely will reach out to you regularly to come on the show. The goal of the application is to begin to cultivate community panelists, so I want to tease out varying points of interest you may have (or may not even know is relevant!). \n\nYou don't apply for a specific show, you apply to join the show and I pair you with a show that makes sense for you! \n\n*I'm a regular DGG orbiter and streamer, do I need to apply?*  \nFor my brain's sake, yes please, just so all panelist information is still in one location. \n\n*How will I know I have been accepted onto the show?*   \nMy aim is to contact you a minimum of two weeks before show dates to offer you shows. I will try to get back to you sooner, but this world tends to be reactive so I may need to pivot last minute. \n\nAfter you apply, I will review your application and if I think you would be a good fit for the show, I will set up an interview. I am still waffling about this, but I think I will interview you publicly online on my stream. This way I can see how you react to live content, as well as get you a bit more comfortable being on a public livestream! If however, this strategy is not working, then I will move to off-stream interviews with a similar format (very conversational). \n\nAfter the interview, I will email you, as stated above, ideally 2 weeks before a show to see if you can come out to Miami. \n\n*There is a spelling or grammar error on the application or the questions are poor/unclear.* \n\nIf you notice something off with the application please notify me so I can fix it. \n\nContact me @:   \nDiscord: notsoErudite  \nEmail: [notsoerudite2022@gmail.com](mailto:notsoerudite2022@gmail.com)\n\nWe reserve the right to make final decisions on the format of the application.   \n\n\n*I will make another comment to this post so I can edit it with further questions asked in the comments below. This is my second time writing this up! (save now) So it was done faster and therefore I may have left out key details. If you post a question, please refer to the comment I made answering further questions.* ",
